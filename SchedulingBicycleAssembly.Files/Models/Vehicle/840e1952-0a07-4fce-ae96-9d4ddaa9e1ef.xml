    <ChangeDescription Version="74">Version 2.36: Updated the Vehicle object to provide a ResourceState state variable tracking Idle, Busy, and Failed states (and statistics). Additionally, an 'On Demand' routing type vehicle may now be used as a moveable resource that is seized and released for tasks by model process logic. Significant changes to the Vehicle object's process logic were made to support these new features. An obsoleted 'IsIdle' state variable and 'RideReserved' event were also removed.</ChangeDescription>
    <ChangeDescription Version="75">Version 2.38: Updated the Vehicle object to fix a bug where the vehicle's process logic sometimes hung if using the 'Loaded' or 'Unloaded' add-on process trigger features. This fix to the Vehicle process logic involved adding a Math.Epsilon delay into the 'OnRiderLoading' and 'OnRiderUnloading' processes.</ChangeDescription>
    <ChangeDescription Version="76">Version 2.39: Updated the Vehicle object process logic to specify all of the object's process delays as non-interruptible.</ChangeDescription>
    <ChangeDescription Version="94">Version 2.40: The 'Transport Logic' property category is now first in the category display order in the Properties Window. The 'None' Idle Action option was renamed to 'Remain In Place'. The display name for the EvaluatingAllocationAddOnProcess property was changed to 'Evaluating Seize Request'. The display name for the EvaluatingRiderAddOnProcess was changed to 'Evaluating Transport Request'. The 'Network' and 'Desired Speed' property display names were changed to 'Initial Network' and 'Initial Desired Speed' respectively. New 'Allocated' and 'Released' add-on process triggers were added and the 'Allocated' and 'Released' events fired by the vehicle were made public. Added a new 'Allocated' public process. Added 'Transporting' and 'FailedBusy' state values to the object's ResourceState state variable. Restructured the failure-related process logic. In the object process logic, the 'Action' property for all Execute steps executing an 'add-on process' is now specified as 'WaitUntilCompleted'.</ChangeDescription>

    <ChangeDescription Version="96">Version 3.42: Changes related to setting the 'Token Associated Object Destroyed Action' option for process logic in this object.</ChangeDescription>
    <ChangeDescription Version="99">Version 3.43: Updated the Vehicle object's OnVisitingNode process logic to now include a SelectVisit step attempt that searches for an accepted visit request (either a transport pickup or a seize visit) before considering the vehicle as 'Idle'. Also, if the vehicle resource is released from transporting activity and then immediately reseized, added some decision logic to account for possibility of the new Seize requesting a visit to the same node destination as the vehicle's current node.</ChangeDescription>
    <ChangeDescription Version="100">Version 3.44: 'SeizedObjects.UnitsOwned' function renamed to 'SeizedObjects.CapacityUnitsOwned'.</ChangeDescription>

    <ChangeDescription Version="104">Version 3.46: Removed special-casing of ride capacity '1' in the vehicle's OnVisitingNode process to allow dynamic assignments of the vehicle's ride capacity to consistently work as expected.</ChangeDescription>
    <ChangeDescription Version="107">Version 3.47: Updated the Vehicle object's process logic to handle the scenario where, if the vehicle has picked up a rider who did not make a reservation, the vehicle will still accept multiple transport reservation requests up to its ride capacity while at the same pickup point. A vehicle object also now always immediately goes into the Transporting state if picking up an unreserved rider. Added new 'Appearance' property category.</ChangeDescription>
    <ChangeDescription Version="112">Version 3.49: Specified the 'OnAssociatedObjectTransferRequested' property of some processes as 'EndProcess'. The 'Exiting Node' add-on process trigger is now also called when the Worker is exiting a node by parking in the node's parking station. Added new 'Park While Busy' and 'Park to Load/Unload' properties.</ChangeDescription>

OnRunInitialized process logic - After parking at the initial node, do a PlanVisit step to check for initial move or transport requests. 'Dynamic Objects' property category renamed to 'Population'. Added new 'Advanced Options' property category.</ChangeDescription>
    <ChangeDescription Version="131">Version 4.59: Process logic now uses new entity 'CurrentNode' and 'DestinationNode' object reference functions instead of deprecated 'CurrentNodeID' and 'DestinationNodeID' functions.</ChangeDescription>
    <ChangeDescription Version="132">Version 4.60: Process logic now uses new object 'SeizedResources.CapacityUnitsOwned' function instead of deprecated 'SeizedObjects.CapacityUnitsOwned'.</ChangeDescription>

    <ChangeDescription Version="194">Version 6.103: Some property description updates.</ChangeDescription>
    <ChangeDescription Version="195">Version 6.112: If a fixed route vehicle goes offshift while there are still outstanding ride pickup reservations or while an entity is being loaded, then the vehicle now goes into the 'OffShiftTransporting' state instead of 'OffShift'.</ChangeDescription>
    <ChangeDescription Version="197">Version 7.121: 'OnVisitingNode' process logic - When released from a processing task, if the vehicle has been kept reserved then delay the executing token for an epsilon time before checking whether to exit the current node, to allow for possible new tasks at the same node.</ChangeDescription>
    <ChangeDescription Version="205">Version 7.122: Simplification of the 'OnEvaluatingSeizeRequest' process logic - The Simio engine now automatically ignores checking this decision process if the vehicle is trying to seize itself. 'OnVisitingNode' process logic - After attempting transport dropoffs and pickups, if the vehicle has been kept as a reserved resource then delay the executing token for an epsilon time before potentially performing any idle actions, to allow for possible new tasks at the same node.'OnRiderUnloading' process logic replaced by new 'OnRiderUnloaded' standard interface process, plus related changes to affected portions of the 'OnVisitingNode' process logic.
